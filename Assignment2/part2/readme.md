Description
The shortest_neighbor_distance class contains a static method findneighbors that calculates the index of the pair of neighboring elements in an input array with the shortest absolute distance between them. This class provides a straightforward solution for identifying the closest neighbors in a sequence of integers, enabling efficient analysis of proximity within the data.

Usage
To utilize the findneighbors method, pass an array of integers as input. The method will then analyze the array and return the index of the pair of neighboring elements with the shortest absolute distance between them. If the input array has fewer than two elements, the method will return -1 to indicate an invalid input.
