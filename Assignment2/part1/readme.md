even_odd Class
Description
The even_odd class contains a method part1 that separates even and odd numbers from an input array and stores them in separate arrays. This class is designed to provide a simple and efficient solution for partitioning integers into even and odd categories, allowing for easy analysis and manipulation of data based on parity.

Usage
To utilize the part1 method, instantiate an object of the even_odd class and call the method, passing an array of integers as input. The method will then process the array, extracting even and odd numbers and printing them in separate arrays for further examination.

Output
Upon calling the part1 method with an input array of integers, the method will print three arrays: the original array, the array containing even numbers, and the array containing odd numbers. This output provides clear insights into the distribution of even and odd numbers within the input data, facilitating subsequent analysis or processing steps.
