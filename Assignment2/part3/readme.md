Description:
The main1 class contains a method convertArrayListToArray for converting an ArrayList of integers into an array of integers. This class serves as a utility for seamlessly converting data structures between ArrayList and array formats, facilitating interoperability and data manipulation tasks.

Method:

convertArrayListToArray(List<Integer> arrayList): This method takes a List of Integers as input (representing an ArrayList) and converts it into an array of integers. It iterates over each element of the ArrayList and populates the corresponding index in the array with the element's value.
Usage:
To utilize the convertArrayListToArray method, instantiate an object of the main1 class and call the method, passing an ArrayList of integers as an argument. The method will then convert the ArrayList into an array and print both the original ArrayList and the converted array.
