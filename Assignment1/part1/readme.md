This Java program provides a user-friendly console interface for performing two mathematical operations: calculating factorials and generating Fibonacci sequences. Below is a breakdown of its functionality:

Main Function (main(String[] args)):

Serves as the entry point of the program.
Sets up a BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
Presents a menu with options for calculating a factorial, generating a Fibonacci sequence, or exiting the program.
Continuously loops until the user chooses to exit.
Handles user choices using a switch statement, invoking the corresponding functions or exiting the loop.

Factorial Calculation (calculateFactorial(int n)):

Accepts an integer n as input and calculates its factorial recursively.
Defines base cases for n equal to 0 or 1, returning 1 since the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.
For n greater than 1, recursively calls itself with n-1, multiplying the result by n until reaching a base case.
Fibonacci Sequence Generation (generateFibonacci(int numTerms)):

Prints the first numTerms of the Fibonacci sequence.
Initializes the first two terms of the sequence (0 and 1) and iteratively calculates subsequent terms by summing the last two terms.
Generates the sequence in a loop running numTerms times, updating term values after each iteration.
Prints each term, thereby displaying the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.
Overall, this program provides a straightforward way for users to perform factorial calculations and generate Fibonacci sequences through an interactive console interface.
