The project implements a menu-driven calculator in Java with various arithmetic and statistical functions. Here's a summary of its components and functionalities:

Calculator Class:

Contains methods for basic arithmetic operations, square root, power, mean, and variance calculations.
Functions include:
add(double a, double b): Adds two numbers.
subtract(double a, double b): Subtracts one number from another.
multiply(double a, double b): Multiplies two numbers.
divide(double a, double b): Divides one number by another.
sqrt(double a): Calculates the square root of a number.
power(double a, double b): Raises a number to the power of another.
mean(double[] numbers): Calculates the mean of an array of numbers.
variance(double[] numbers): Calculates the variance of an array of numbers.
