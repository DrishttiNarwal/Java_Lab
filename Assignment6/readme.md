# Stack Implementation in Java

This is a Java program that implements a stack data structure using an array-based approach. The program provides basic operations such as push, pop, display, and checks for underflow and overflow conditions.

## Features

- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove and return the element from the top of the stack.
- Display: Print all elements currently in the stack.
- Check for underflow: Determine if the stack is empty.
- Check for overflow: Determine if the stack is full (in this implementation, stack capacity is fixed).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (optional but recommended).

### Running the Program

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` file.
4. Follow the prompts to interact with the stack.

## Usage

- Upon running the program, you'll be presented with a menu listing different stack operations.
- Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.
- Follow the prompts to push elements onto the stack, pop elements, display the stack contents, or check for underflow/overflow conditions.
- The program will display appropriate messages and results based on your actions.
